        Here's some other interesting information
      </h2>
        <p>
            Bee Movie is the work of Jerry Sienfeld. It came up over dinner with Steven Spielberg.
            Sienfeld was apparently really in-tune with Barry Bee, the main character. As the movie developed, Jerry became one with Barry.
            What I mean by that is when the cast was voicing their characters, Jerry was really starting to become barry, and the animators at Dreamworks helped aid that on screen.
            Apparently, the entire script, which is all over <a href="index.html">this entire site</a>, took on 215 iterations. Bee Movie had a budget of $150 million, and had a net profit of $27 million.
